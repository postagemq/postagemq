### Credits

First of all I want to mention and thank the [Erlang](www.erlang.org) and [RabbitMQ](www.rabbitmq.com) teams and the maintainer of [pika](https://github.com/pika/pika), Gavin M. Roy, for their hard work, and for releasing such amazing pieces of software as open source.

Many thanks to [Jeff Knupp](http://www.jeffknupp.com/about-me/) for his post [Open Sourcing a Python Project the Right Way](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/) and to [Audrey M. Roy](http://www.audreymroy.com/) for her [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) tools. All those things make Python packaging a breeze.
